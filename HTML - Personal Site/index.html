  <h1>Jonathan Shaw</h1>
  <p><em>Software Engineer at <strong><a href="https://www.boozallen.com/" target="_blank">Booz Allen Hamilton</a></strong></em></p>
  <p>
    I graduated from Methodist University, May 2019, with a BS in Computer Science and a BS in Computer Information Technologies. For the past two years I’ve been employed as a software engineer developing linux-based platform software written utilizing Java, C++, Python, MySQL, protocol buffers, and bash and tcsh scripting. I’m SCRUM Master certified and I’ve served as a SCRUM master for nine months in a semi-agile environment. I am most comfortable with Java and object-oriented programming, but I don’t use that as an excuse to shy away from learning new languages, systems, or techniques. My primary motivation is solving real problems that affect the client.
